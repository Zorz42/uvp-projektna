Notes:
- Commit messages were written by AI.
- Github Copilot was used during development.
- ChatGpt was used to give examples and answer questions about library usages (such as pandas or matplotlib etc...)
- Ai only wrote small pieces of code. Project idea, architecture and code structure was made by me.
More than half of all characters in the code were manually written by me. The remaining code was mostly only autocompleted by AI.
